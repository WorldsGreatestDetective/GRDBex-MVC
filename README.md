# GRDBex-MVC

GRDBex-MVC is a demo app that takes in a users full name then saves it to a SQLite database via GRDB and a remote MySQL database via a RESTful API. After taking in the users name the application displays the users name on the following view controller where the user can also see a list of all names saved to the database.

This app performs routine asynchronous network requests via swiftâ€™s async/await.
