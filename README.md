# GRDBex-MVC

GRDBex-MVC is a demo app that takes in a users full name and saves it to a SQLite database via [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift); a SQLite wrapper. 
After taking in the users name the application displays the users name on the following view controller where the user can also see a list of all names saved to the database.

This app also demos more maintainable and testable code by properly applying the MVC architecture via dependency injections, protocols, etc...
