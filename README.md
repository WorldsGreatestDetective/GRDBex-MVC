# GRDBex-MVC

GRDBex-MVC is a demo app that takes in a users full name then saves it to a SQLite database via GRDB and a remote MySQL database via a RESTful API. After taking in the users name the application displays the users name on the following view controller where the user can also see a list of all names saved to the database.

This app performs routine asynchronous network requests via swiftâ€™s async/await. The remote server is not always online; contact [WorldsGreatestDetective](https://github.com/WorldsGreatestDetective) if need be.

## Overview

Simply enter your name and tap to save it to the database

The app will then save it to a SQLite database and display it in the center of the screen where there is an option to return
